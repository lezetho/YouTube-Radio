> **Notice:** This project is no longer maintained for a number of reasons. For one, **I do not use Discord.JS v13 anymore**. It's simply out-of-date and I'd rather use v14. Another reason is that it goes against YouTube's ToS. YouTube has banned the use of YouTube on Discord bots (something around that, you should research it in your free time) and the package I am using for this (ytdl) is impacted with this. You can make edits if you'd like however there will be no updates on this project anymore.
